# R-and-PowerBI

As stated in the project notes we had to follow a number of steps in order to produce the final report using R and PowerBI in conjunction
First step: R

•	Initial Exploratory Analysis 
•	Clean the data
•	Exploratory Data Analysis
•	Export Data 

Second step: PowerBi

•	Client brief and Data request for dashboard
Initial Exploratory Analysis
The first stage was to check the data via the link to visually see what information we were looking at before importing it into R, to then compare.
I started with R  by loading datafile (DF) via the link we were provided with, once the load string was run the data appeared in the Environment as shown on the right screen ( on the screen shot. Note: In the environment window you can see that the rows and columns as stated, by clicking on table it will bring up a table view of the df).
#Load data 
•	df<- read.csv("https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/HollywoodsMostProfitableStories.csv")

In order to execute a command you must select run after each string input.
